rusty_python is a code linter that helps lazy people like me to write (better?,faster?,easier?) Rust code.
As an absolute Rust beginner loads of things were a pain, like writing `println!` rather than simply `print`. So,
as any programmer does, I spent a considerable amount of time automating tasks that won't take me long to do
manually. 

This linter comes after I created a source to source self compiling Python compiler. (loads of fancy comp sci words),
to call it a compiler was technically true but a stretch, it mainly used static code analysis and RegEx to replace
parts of the code.

This project aims to do something similar, this is to all my Python devs out there, coming in the memory safe land
of Rust.
